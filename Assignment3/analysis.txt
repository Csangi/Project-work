Stack clear() analysis

template <typename T>
void Stack<T>::clear()
{
	while(!empty())			//Here we loop until the stack is empty 
		pop();				//and we call pop on the stack which calls pop_back on the vector
}


The complexity analysis comes out to big O of n or O(n) because we only have to loop through the length of the 
vector array and the pop function only shortens the size of the vector by one everytime so there is no 
reallocation nessessary like how there would be if we pushed instead of popped.
